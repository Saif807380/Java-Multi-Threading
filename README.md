# Multi-threading using Java
Few examples of implementing multi-threading in Java. The output may vary for different operating systems and depends on how the corresponding OS schedules the threads.

## Packages Used
```bash
java.util.concurrent
```

## Multi-Threading
Synchronized concurrent thread-safe transactions are executed by different threads on the same object. This example demonstrates the different ways in which multiple threads can be synchronized such as,

* Making methods of the class `synchronized`
* Using a `sychronization` block
* Using a `Re-entrant` lock
* Using a `Re-entrant` lock with `tryLock()` method

## Deadlock
An example that illustrates a deadlock by making two threads acquire access to two shared resources in reverse order leading to a hold and wait situation.

## Producer-Consumer Problem
Producer-Consumer problem is solved using by synchronization, which enforces mutual exclusion, preventing deadlock. The `produce`r produces the items and puts them on the shared `buffer`. The different `consumer` threads then consume the items of the `buffer` if the `buffer` is not empty, else they wait for the `producer` to produce more items. It cannot be determined which item will be consumed by which thread and depends completely on how the OS schedules the threads.
